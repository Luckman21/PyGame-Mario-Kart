# PyGame-Mario-Kart

A PyGame project where I developed my own version of Mario Kart, with a fully functional player and CPU!

Since music track files were too large to upload to Github, here are the list of wav files you will need to add.  
Download the music tracks and rename them to the following:

Mariokart Wii (Lose Theme) - Lose.wav
Mariokart 8 (Mario Kart Stadium) - Track1_Music.wav
Mariokart Double Dash (Peach Beach / Daisy Cruiser) - Track2_Music.wav
Mariokart Wii (Bowser's Castle Theme [Outside]) - Track3_Music.wav
Super Smash Bros. Brawl (Frozen Hillside) - Track4_Music.wav
Mariokart Wii (First Place Music) - Win.wav

The wav files go in the Music folder ^
